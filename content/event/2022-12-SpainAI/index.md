summary: A high level introduction about ethics in Artificial Intelligence, why does discrimination occurs and how to solve it using AI [Scientific Dissemination talk].
abstract: "Machine learning models are becoming major tools for addressing complex social problems and are also increasingly used to make or support decisions about individuals in many consequential areas of their lives, from justice to healthcare. It is therefore necessary to consider the ethical implications of such decisions, including concepts such as privacy, transparency, accountability, reliability, trustworthiness, autonomy, and fairness. Specifically, we will explain the current landscape of algorithmic fairness in AI, i.e., that algorithms make unbiased decisions without discrimination. We will go from the reasons why these algorithms make these biased decisions, to ways to solve this problem. In addition, we will comment on how algorithmic fairness is also present in the valuation of our data or in social networks. The main goal is to provide an overview of what algorithmic justice is, as well as the main technical and social challenges that the community has to address."
