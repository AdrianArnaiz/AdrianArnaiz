Adrian Arnaiz gave a talk on "AI for Social Good" at the Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Seville as part of the Teaching Innovation Project “Final Projects in Philosophy in the Context of AI”, which aims to raise awareness of the risks and opportunities of AI for the Professors of Philosophy.

The presentation focused on three key aspects:

1. **Understanding AI and its Application**: it was explained how AI enables machines to learn from data and make complex decisions, from pattern identification to content generation and human-IA collaboration. Practical examples included the use of virtual assistants, inclusive communication tools, and adaptive systems for special needs.

2. **Ethical issues of AI**: Speakers addressed the associated ethical challenges, such as lack of privacy, discrimination and biases in AI models. Specific risks for people with intellectual disabilities, who may be more vulnerable to manipulation and misuse of personalisation systems, were highlighted.

3. **Regulation (Trustworthy AI and AI Act)**: How these ethical principles are translated into regulation in the new AI Act.
