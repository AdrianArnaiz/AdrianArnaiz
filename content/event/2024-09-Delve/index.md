event: Delve Deep Learning - Online Course
event_url: https://delveeducation.github.io/

location: Online, Center and South America 

summary: 3h practical and theoretical lecture about GNNs, as part of the Delve Deep Learning Online course. The course is aimed at professionals, companies and future entrepreneurs-researchers from different sectors of activity.
abstract: "In this lecture, we will delve into the world of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We will start by understanding the basics of graph theory and how it can be used to represent data. Then, we will introduce the concept of GNNs and how they can be used to learn from graph-structured data. We will cover different types of GNNs, including Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs), and GraphSAGE. Finally, we will discuss some applications of GNNs in various domains, such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, and bioinformatics."
