**ðŸŽ“ Organized by:** Red.es & UCLM  
**ðŸ”¬ In collaboration with:** ELLIS Alicante & ADAPT Foundation  


I had the pleasure of participating in the **Workshop on the Impact of Artificial Intelligence Technologies in Workforce Management**, a seminar focused on the implications of AI in labor environments â€” particularly in the management and direction of people at work.

The event was part of the collaboration agreement between **Red.es** and the **University of Castilla-La Mancha (UCLM)**, aimed at implementing **digital rights in workplace settings** as outlined in the Spanish *Charter of Digital Rights*. It was directed by **Nuria Oliver** (Scientific Director at ELLIS Alicante) and **Luz RodrÃ­guez** (Professor of Labour Law and Social Security at UCLM), with organizational support from **Carolina Bastante** and **Alfonso Haro**.

During the second session, I presented a talk titled **"Algorithmic Bias and Discrimination"**, where I discussed:

- How algorithmic systems used in workforce management can encode and amplify social biases  
- Real-world examples of discriminatory outcomes in HR-related AI applications  
- Technical and regulatory mechanisms to detect and mitigate such risks  

This topic is especially relevant as AI becomes increasingly embedded in hiring, evaluation, and other workplace processes. Ensuring fairness, transparency, and accountability must remain a top priority.

**Session 1 (10:30â€“12:00)**  
- Luz RodrÃ­guez on gender perspectives in AI usage at work  
- Emanuele Dagnino (UNIMI/ADAPT) explored transparency and worker representation in AI regulations in Italy, Spain, and Germany  
- Julio Losada CarreÃ±o (ITSS) discussed compliance authorities and procedures  

**Session 2 (13:30â€“15:00)**  
- AdriÃ¡n Arnaiz RodrÃ­guez on Algorithmic Bias and Discrimination in Worker Management
- Nuria Oliver tackled cognitive biases in AI  
- Carlos Castillo (UPF) covered AI-driven hiring  
- Followed by a collective debate and closing remarks from Rosa DÃ­az Moles (Director, ONTSI)


It was a privilege to contribute to this essential dialogue on ethical AI in the workplace. The seminar underscored the importance of safeguarding **digital and human rights** amidst the growing deployment of AI in HR processes. Many thanks to the organizers and fellow experts for such a thoughtâ€‘provoking event.
