I had the honor of giving a talk to a distinguished group of opinion leaders in Spain, representing key voices in media, technology, and education. Among the participants were:

- **Alberto Iglesias**, director of *DISRUPTORES* at *El Español*  
- **Juan Zafra**, director of the magazine *Telos* and general director of *CLABE* (Club Abierto de Editores)  
- **Enrique Coperías**, former director of the magazine *Muy Interesante*  
- **Pilar Bernat**, editor at *Zona Movilidad*  
- **Juan Carlos F. Galindo**, contributor to *Muy Interesante*, *Telos*, and *Zona Movilidad*, and director of Communication and Social Marketing at *Inbusiness 5.0*  
- **Adriana Botelho**, co-founder and CEO of *KeepCoding* ([keepcoding.io](https://keepcoding.io))

It was a great opportunity to exchange ideas on the future of media, tech innovation, IT education, and the role of science communication in society.
