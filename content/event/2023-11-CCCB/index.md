event_url: https://www.cccb.org/en/activities/file/algorithmic-societies/243038

location: Centre de Cultura Contemporania de Barcelona (CCCB)

summary: International seminar coorganised by the CCCB and the ERC project Algorithmic Societies about the AI social impacts. I gave a talk and participated on a round table about the role of AI on discrimination. I participated with Thao Phan (Monash University), Scott Wark (University of Kent), Rocco Bellanova (Free University of Brussels), Carlos Castillo (ICREA-Pompeu Fabra University) and Piera Riccio (ELLIS Alicante(). Moderated by Jordi Pérez Colomé (El Pais)
abstract: "From clustering technologies to racialised surveillance and profiling, new spatial divisions are emerging in the algorithmic society. How is AI discriminating among populations of people? What are the implications for categories of race, gender and sexuality?"

### Algorithmic Societies
*Ethics and policy in the artificial intelligence age - 21 and 22 November 2023 - CCCB Barcelona*

**International seminar coorganised by the CCCB and the European project Algorithmic Societies about the AI social impacts. Coorganized by CCCB and [*Algorithmic Societies* a 5yr Advanced Grant, European Research Council](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/883107). PI Professor Louise Amoore.**

During the event, I participated on Wednesday, November 22 (10:00 – 11:45) on the next panel session:

**Algorithmic discriminations**

From clustering technologies to racialised surveillance and profiling, new spatial divisions are emerging in the algorithmic society. How is AI discriminating among populations of people? What are the implications for categories of race, gender and sexuality?
