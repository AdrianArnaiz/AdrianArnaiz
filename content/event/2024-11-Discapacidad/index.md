On 8 November, Adrian Arnaiz and Erik Derner, researchers at ELLIS Alicante, presented their paper entitled ‘Artificial Intelligence and Human Wellbeing’ at the 5th Conference on Intellectual Disability, organised by the San Rafael Foundation. With approximately 150 attendees, the event was an ideal setting to explore the challenges and opportunities offered by artificial intelligence (AI) to support people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
The exhibition began with an introduction on the role of ELLIS (European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems), a pan-European research network dedicated to the ethical development of AI. In particular, the work of ELLIS Alicante was highlighted as the first Spanish unit, with a focus on the relationship between people and intelligent systems.

The presentation focused on three key aspects:

1. **Understanding AI and its Application**: it was explained how AI enables machines to learn from data and make complex decisions, from pattern identification to content generation and human-IA collaboration. Practical examples included the use of virtual assistants, inclusive communication tools, and adaptive systems for special needs.

2. **Ethical issues of AI**: Speakers addressed the associated ethical challenges, such as lack of privacy, discrimination and biases in AI models. Specific risks for people with intellectual disabilities, who may be more vulnerable to manipulation and misuse of personalisation systems, were highlighted.
3. **Mitigating Risks and Promoting Wellbeing**: An essential part of the presentation was the emphasis on ‘ethical and trustworthy AI’. The researchers detailed strategies to mitigate bias and improve transparency in algorithmic decision-making, promoting the use of AI as a catalyst for human well-being and social inclusion.

The presentation was met with great interest from the audience, who asked numerous questions about the risks and benefits of AI. The active interaction of the audience reflected a growing interest in understanding how technology can improve support systems and quality of life.

The participation of Adrian Arnaiz and Erik Derner in this conference reaffirms ELLIS Alicante's commitment to the development of ethical artificial intelligence that prioritises human well-being. Their success in this forum is an example of the transformative potential of AI when implemented with responsibility and an inclusive vision.
