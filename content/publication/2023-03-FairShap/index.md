abstract: "Algorithmic fairness is of utmost societal importance, yet state-of-the-art largescale machine learning models require training with massive datasets that are frequently biased. In this context, pre-processing methods that focus on modeling and correcting bias in the data emerge as valuable approaches. In this paper, we propose **FairShap**, a novel instance-level data re-weighting method for fair algorithmic decision-making through data valuation by means of Shapley Values. **FairShap** is model-agnostic and easily interpretable. It measures the contribution of each training data point to a predefined fairness metric. We empirically validate **FairShap** on several state-of-the-art datasets of different nature, with a variety of training scenarios and machine learning models and show how it yields fairer models with similar levels of accuracy than the baselines. We illustrate **FairShap**â€™s interpretability by means of histograms and latent space visualizations and perform a utility-fairness study. We believe that **FairShap** represents a promising direction in interpretable and model-agnostic approaches to algorithmic fairness that yield competitive accuracy even when only biased datasets are available"

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: FairShap, i.e. Fair Shapley Values, is a family of data valuation functions for Algorithmic Fairness based on Game Theory which can be used as a novel, interpretable, pre-processing and model-agnostic (re-weighting) method for fair algorithmic decision-making.
