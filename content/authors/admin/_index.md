[**THIS PAGE IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT (AS PUBLICATIONS OR BLOG POSTS), SOME INFORMATION IS THE DEFAULT GIVEN BY WOWCHEMY. SOON EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE READY FOR ALL OF YOU**]

I am a Spanish boy born in 97. I am a Computer Scientist, with a Master's in Data Science, focused on my early academic career. I am working on the application of **ML** and **DL** methods to **life science**, and **network science** applied to social networks. However I am passionate about many other fields of **AI**. My passion for research and AI started in 2018 when I was awarded a research scholarship from Spanish Ministry of Education in order to carry out my BSc thesis at [ADMIRABLE](https://admirable-ubu.es/) Burgos’ University research group which, among more works, led me to get the Bsc Extraordinary acadmic mention.

I mainly have worked in the intersection of ML, DL and Medicine in my [Bachelor's](https://github.com/AdrianArnaiz/TFG-Neurodegenerative-Disease-Detection) and [Master's Thesis](https://github.com/AdrianArnaiz/Brain-MRI-Autoencoder) both with outstanding results (*honours*). Besides, I (we) have also research in the Network Science field, leading to 2 conference papers. However, I am discovering new fields that also delight me, as **Reinforcement Learning** (graded with honors in the Master's subject) or **GNN**.

Although I have mostly worked in AI applications, I am also keen on deepening in theoretical concepts of each topic, with a great interest in the most intrinsic and mathematical operation of the algorithms *enjoying* when it makes me work up a sweat. Therefore, I am also enthusiastic about fully understand the essence of any topic I worked on which turns me very eager to learn, and improves my research capacity both reviewing the SoTA and proposing new perspectives.

Last but not least, I love to spend time playing guitar :guitar: and clarinet and also sweat a bit cycling :bike: and playing soccer :soccer:.
