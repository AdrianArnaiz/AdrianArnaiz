**Hola**üëãüèº **!**

I am a postdoctoral researcher at [ELLIS Alicante](https://ellisalicante.org/). My research focuses on building **trustworthy AI** (‚öñÔ∏è+ü§ñ) systems for *high-stakes decisions*, *social networks*, and *recommender systems*, and on exploring how these technologies intersect with *AI regulation*, *standardization*, and *policy-making* üèõÔ∏è. I am also passionate about  **graph neural networks** (GNNs) üï∏Ô∏è and how we can better understand their challenges to improve model performance and interpretability.

------

I completed my PhD at [ELLIS Alicante](https://ellisalicante.org/), advised by [Nuria Oliver](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuria_Oliver), and was a visiting researcher at [MPI-SWS](https://www.mpi-sws.org/) hosted by [Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~manuelgr/) as part of the [ELLIS PhD & PostDoc Program](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc).

During my PhD, I collaborated closely with [Intel Labs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/artificial-intelligence/responsible-ai.html#tab-blade-1-1) through the RESUMAIS project and with [Bank Sabadell](https://www.bancsabadell.com/), and I was also part of the [ELIAS](https://elias-ai.eu/) European project. 
In addition, some of my work on AI governance contributed to the development of the [Spanish Charter of Digital Rights](https://www.derechosdigitales.gob.es/es/carta-espanola-de-derechos-digitales).
This work on algorithmic fairness, human-AI collaboration and its alignment with regulatory frameworks is summarized in *[A Sociotechnical Approach to Trustworthy AI: from Algorithms to Regulation](https://ellisalicante.org/publications/arnaiz2025thesis-en/)*, my PhD thesis.

In addition, my work on GNNs has also led to several publications and to our [**ICML 2024** tutorial on *Graph Learning: Principles, Challenges, and Open Directions*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rd_8QcPg6kw), co-organized with [Ameya Velingker](https://www.ameyavelingker.com/).


Before starting my PhD, I worked on **network science** and **ML for life sciences** at both the [Open University of Catalonia (UOC)](https://www.uoc.edu/), where I completed my [MSc thesis](https://github.com/AdrianArnaiz/Brain-MRI-Autoencoder) with [Baris Kanber](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/52758) (UCL), and at [Burgos University (UBU)](https://admirable-ubu.es/), where I completed my [BSc thesis](https://github.com/AdrianArnaiz/TFG-Neurodegenerative-Disease-Detection) with a research scholarship.



<!--üëãüèº Hi! I'm Adri√°n, a postdoctoral researcher at ELLIS Alicante, where I work on trustworthy AI and recommender systems; and graph-based machine learning. My research explores how AI can support high-stakes decisions in areas like social networks, recommender systems, and policy-making, while aligning with emerging regulations and societal values.

I completed my PhD at ELLIS Alicante under Nuria Oliver, spent time as a visiting researcher at MPI-SWS with Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez, and collaborated with Intel Labs. My work also contributed to Spain's Charter of Digital Rights.

I'm especially passionate about graph learning, both its theory and applications ‚Äî a topic I explored in our ICML 2024 tutorial. Before my PhD, I worked on network science and ML for life sciences during my MSc and BSc studies.-->

<i>Community</i>: My work has been presented at major academic venues (e.g., ICML, ICLR, ICWSM, LoG, etc) and policy platforms including the Joint Research Centre (JRC) and the European Parliament's JURI Committee. I've helped organize conferences such as ICML 2024, LoG (2024 & 2025), and the ELLIS Doctoral Symposium 2022. As a reviewer, I've actively contributed to the community and received Top Reviewer Awards at ICML 2023, AISTATS 2023, and AISTATS 2025.
