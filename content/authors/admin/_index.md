I am a Spanish boy born in 97. I am a Computer Scientist, with a Master's in Data Science, focused on my PhD at ELLIS Network. I am working on the application of **ML** and **DL** methods to **life science**, and **network science** applied to social networks. However, I am passionate about many other fields of **AI**. My passion for research and AI started in 2018 when I was awarded a research scholarship from the Spanish Ministry of Education in order to carry out my BSc thesis at [ADMIRABLE](https://admirable-ubu.es/) Burgos’ University research group which, among more works, led me to get the BSc Extraordinary academic mention.

I mainly have worked in the intersection of ML, DL and Medicine in my [Bachelor's](https://github.com/AdrianArnaiz/TFG-Neurodegenerative-Disease-Detection) and [Master's Thesis](https://github.com/AdrianArnaiz/Brain-MRI-Autoencoder) both with outstanding results (*honours*). Besides, I (we) have also research in the Network Science field, leading to some conference papers. However, I am discovering new fields that also delight me, as **Reinforcement Learning** (graded with honors in the Master's subject) or **GNN**.

Although I have mostly worked in AI applications, I am also keen on deepening in theoretical concepts of each topic, with a great interest in the most intrinsic and mathematical operation of the algorithms *enjoying* when it makes me work up a sweat. Therefore, I am also enthusiastic about fully understand the essence of any topic I worked on which turns me very eager to learn, and improves my research capacity both reviewing the SoTA and proposing new perspectives.

Last but not least, I love to spend time playing guitar :guitar: and clarinet and also sweat a bit cycling :bike: and playing soccer :soccer:.

I am a Spanish boy born in 97. I am a Computer Scientist, with a Master's in Data Science, focused on my PhD in ML at [ELLIS lab](https://ellis.eu) in [Alicante Unit](https://ellisalicante.org/) and I will visit [MPI-SWS](https://www.mpi-sws.org/) as part of the [ELLIS PhD & PostDoc program](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc). I am advised by Dr. [Nuria Oliver](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuria_Oliver), [Dr. Manuel Gómez Rodríguez](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~manuelgr/) and [Dr. Francisco Escolano](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pAe4Pf8AAAAJ&hl=es).

 I've mainly worked on the application of **ML** and **DL** methods to **life science**, and **network science** and **graph theory**, as in my [Bachelor's](https://github.com/AdrianArnaiz/TFG-Neurodegenerative-Disease-Detection) and [Master's Thesis](https://github.com/AdrianArnaiz/Brain-MRI-Autoencoder) - both with outstanding results (*honours*) -  and leading to some conference papers as well. However, I am passionate about many other fields of **AI**, thus, we will sharpen the main topic of the PhD in the coming months. My passion for research and AI started in 2018 when I was awarded a research scholarship from the Spanish Ministry of Education in order to carry out my BSc thesis at [ADMIRABLE](https://admirable-ubu.es/) Burgos’ University research group which, among more works, led me to get the BSc Extraordinary academic mention. I've also been awarded in 2021 a Spanish FPU fellowship, which I had to decline due to scholarship incompatibilities. 

Although I have mostly worked in AI applications, I am also keen on deepening in theoretical concepts of each topic, with a great interest in the most intrinsic and mathematical implications of the algorithms *enjoying* when it makes me work up a sweat. 

Last but not least, I love to spend time playing guitar :guitar: and clarinet and also sweat a bit cycling :bike: and playing soccer :soccer:.
